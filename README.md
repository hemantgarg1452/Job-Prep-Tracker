## 🚀 Why I Built This

As an aspiring backend developer, I found myself juggling between DSA prep, job applications, and resume updates — often in cluttered Google Sheets.  
So, I built a **real-world, modular, and automated job-prep system** to replace all that mess.

## 🧠 Core Features

### 📌 DSA Tracker
- Spaced Repetition Logic (3-5-9 rule) for smart revision
- Add problems with tags, difficulty & revisit timers
- Auto-reminders for pending revisions

### 💼 Job Tracker
- Add job links, auto-parse JD using **JSoup**
- Pre-fills fields intelligently (company, role, location)
- Track applied, rejected, interviews, etc.

### 📄 Resume Tracker
- Resume versioning & tagging  
- _(Upcoming)_ Resume scoring and feedback system using AI
